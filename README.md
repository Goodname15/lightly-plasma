# lightly-plasma
An attempt at making a [Plasma Style](https://develop.kde.org/docs/extend/plasma/theme/theme-details/) for the [Lightly Application Style](https://github.com/Luwx/Lightly).

Currently, it suffers from several problems:

 - Buttons are very big and break unchecked checkboxes in Plasma
 - Cannot adapt outlines from Light to Dark the way Lightly can
 - Margins/padding stretch Kickoff a bit
 - No `opaque/` support for disabled compositing
 - `tabbar.svg` is a bit questionable in its implementation
 - I would like some [Contrast Effect presets](https://niccolo.venerandi.com/backstage/files/ownopacity/main.html) that can work for Light and Dark
